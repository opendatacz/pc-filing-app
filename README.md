# pc-filing-app

Application for filing public contracts

## Deployment

In order to configure the application, copy the public configuration file from `/src/main/resources/cz/opendata/tenderstats/config/config.xml`, fill in missing configuration, and save it as your private configuration file. The application needs the path to the private configuration to be passed via environment variable `PCFA_CONFIG`; for example:

```bash
export PCFA_CONFIG=/path/to/config-private.xml
```
